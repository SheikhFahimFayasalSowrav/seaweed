# **Abstract**

Global aquaculture production of seaweed is a staggering 23.8 million tonnes per year, with a net worth of $6.4 billion USD. The majority of edible seaweeds consumed in California is imported from Asia and local seaweed product is overwhelmingly sourced from wild harvesters in northern California. Reliance on imports and wild harvesting can have large environmental consequences and put additional pressure on regional marine ecosystems. As the demand for local seaweed in California increases interest has grown in developing a seaweed aquaculture industry through both onshore and offshore systems. However, the technical and economic feasibility of growing native California seaweed species as local alternatives to the major imported species — nori, kombu, and wakame— has not been assessed. Our project investigated which seaweed species have the most potential based on market demand and suitability to local environmental conditions. We identified four promising candidates in the Southern California Bight and the appropriate methods for their cultivation. We then developed a bioeconomic model to highlight the key factors that determine the economic feasibility of establishing a seaweed aquaculture industry in the region. Finally, we undertook a preliminary assessment of seaweed integration into an existing local mussel farm. Our results show that regional seaweed aquaculture is economically feasible, that there are important considerations for siting production on or offshore, and that co-culturing seaweed with shellfish can provide a jumpstart to the industry as a whole. These findings provide stakeholders and policymakers a blueprint for prioritizing next steps in expanding sustainable seaweed aquaculture in southern California.

# **Executive Summary**

Seaweed aquaculture is an emerging industry in the United States, but has been established in many Asian countries for centuries. Over one-fifth of global annual aquaculture production comes from seaweed, with the vast majority of that being used for direct human consumption (Moffit, 2014). Seaweed is produced for a wide variety of uses, including pharmaceuticals, biofuel, and agricultural products, but food and health are human necessities that may motivate the more rapid expansion of local, sustainable aquaculture. The rich nutritional profile and low environmental footprint of seaweed contribute to its promise as a sustainable and healthy food source. To date, increasing demand for edible seaweeds in California has been primarily filled by imported products (NOAA Fisheries, 2017). However, the environmental and oceanographic conditions of California’s waters are an untapped resource for seaweed cultivation as evidenced by the dense stands of kelp forest along the coast. The lack of need for freshwater and pesticide inputs makes seaweed aquaculture a prime candidate to sustainably address food security issues in California.


In our project, we focused on seaweed species that satisfy a growing health-conscious community and have a high potential in the southern California food market. We assessed the economic feasibility of starting a seaweed farm in onshore (i.e. land-based) and offshore. Here, offshore is defined as mariculture occurring in ocean but does not necessarily refer to cultivation in deep and distant waters. The main barriers impeding the growth of the industry are high initial capital costs, permitting uncertainty, and a lack of established cultivation methods specific to the region. Our report aims to provide researchers, future farmers, and policy makers comprehensive scientific knowledge about ideal candidate species for edible seaweed cultivation, prospective economic feasibility, and mechanisms to circumvent some of those barriers in the short term.

## Candidate species and cultivation methods

We utilized three criteria to identify edible seaweed species that are ideal for cultivation and sale in southern California: 1) The algae must occur naturally throughout the whole region, 2) have a pre-existing food market in California, and 3) must have established aquaculture techniques. The first condition helps promote a cohesive and collaborative local industry and the latter two are desirable by aquaculturists who want to buy into a system that has a proven history of success. Applying these criteria to the native species of the Bight, the following four species emerge as the most promising candidates:	

* _Gracilaria pacifica_ (ogo or limu) - a delicate red seaweed used as a topping for poke and rice bowls
* *Pyropia perforata* (nori) - a local variant of a highly marketable red genus that is commonly dried for sushi rolls  
* *Ulva lactuca* (sea lettuce) - a productive green species found in soups and seaweed salads
* *Laminaria setchellii* (kombu) - a sturdy brown seaweed that is sought after for use in soup stock or consumed whole

Optimal harvest season and potential productivity for a locale can be estimated by using knowledge of species physiological tolerance ranges and a combination of ambient environmental conditions, such as water temperature, nutrient availability, and photoperiod. The final decision facing a farmer is which grow-out structure to use for a particular species. All four aforementioned species can be grown in tanks onshore. For offshore cultivation, longline culture is most appropriate for G. pacifica and L. setchellii, whereas P. perforata and U. lactuca should be raised used nets. Since the latter two species are more susceptible to rough wave action, siting them in calmer or shallower waters will decrease the likelihood of fragmentation.

## Economic feasibility

We synthesized projected farm yield, initial required capital, and annual operating costs through a bioeconomic model to investigate the key factors that will affect the economic feasibility of seaweed aquaculture in southern California. Seaweed growth rate has a major influence on the viability of a farm system and L. setchellii outperformed the other three candidate species largely due to its high biological productivity and low annual harvest costs. However, as a brown seaweed, it typically has a lower market value than a red species such as P. perforata. This suggests potential trade-offs in species selection between productivity and marketability. Our research also highlights the pros and cons of siting seaweed production on and offshore. Offshore production can be more economically viable due to its lower annual operational costs, but a farmer may be forced to make sacrifices in terms of product quality and increased risk. Additionally, securing a permit for offshore aquaculture has proven to be more difficult than for onshore systems. An aquaculture farmer can have more control over product quality onshore but this comes at the price of higher labor and energy costs. Our models predicts an average price of $11.42/kg across the four species for an onshore farmer to recoup their costs over a five-year time period compared to $6.84/kg offshore. Regardless of location, these “break-even” prices suggest that the cost of seaweed aquaculture in southern California prohibits successful competition on the global market, where seaweed is processed for use as a food additive. Instead, the seaweed industry must position itself to provide a value-added produce or specialty item to be viable. 

## Co-culture with shellfish aquaculture

In California and elsewhere around the globe, seaweed aquaculture has been increasingly associated with shellfish cultivation. These two extractive organisms have been traditionally paired with fed finfish aquaculture, a process known as integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA). However, shellfish and seaweed can also be grown together in isolation. Shellfish farmers benefit from diversifying their product portfolio and potential seaweed farmers can leverage existing permits for shellfish aquaculture to avoid having to obtain a new one. Sharing required infrastructure and novel “3-D” cultivation methods allows for increased yield from a single farm unit. This project demonstrates that an existing mussel farm could increase its profit by substituting seaweed production on to the farm. It is also possible that there are ecological benefits of growing the two species in unison, such as localized buffering of ocean acidification by seaweeds, but further empirical research is needed to corroborate these theories. 

## Recommendations

Seaweed aquaculture can be economically feasible in southern California but barriers exist that prevent the development of a regional industry. We recommend stakeholders should focus their efforts on adapting current cultivation techniques for use in California waters, identifying the most effective marketing strategies, and creating a political framework in support of sustainable best management practices. Future steps will include validating the growth rate estimates utilized in this report and quantifying the health and environmental benefits of seaweed aquaculture for consumers and decision makers. Further research should investigate co-culture with shellfish and the polyculture of multiple seaweed species to maximize economic and biological outcomes. Through increased collaboration between researchers, policy makers, and aquaculture farmers, sustainable seaweed aquaculture can be the next innovation in California’s rich history of food production.

# **Background & Project Objectives**

## Significance

Aquaculture is poised to help address food security issues as the world’s population continues to grow (FAO, 2014). A shift towards more domestic production in the United States would allow for the creation of many jobs and stricter control of the sustainability and environmental impact of the industry. While finfish and shellfish aquaculture have received significant attention in the academic and political realms, the cultivation of edible seaweeds is a relatively novel idea throughout much of the U.S. coastal zone. Seaweeds, or macroscopic algae, are nutrient rich, require very few inputs (including no freshwater), and thrive in the upwelling zone along the coast of the western United States. These facets make the production of seaweed for direct human food use appealing to consumers, policy makers, and aquaculturists alike.
 
Interest in seaweed aquaculture is growing here in southern California, but many questions remain as to the feasibility of the industry. To our knowledge, there has been no assessment of the economic feasibility of growing native California seaweed species for food use. Additionally, no review has summarized which native seaweed species to target, what cultivation methods are most appropriate, and the limitations and uncertainties regarding seaweed aquaculture in California. Our project seeks to address these questions and provide a framework for future studies to build upon when assessing the economic feasibility of seaweed in California and other regions. Additionally, identifying the most ideal seaweed candidates will help direct future research toward these species. 

## Seaweed around the globe

23.8 million tonnes of seaweed are produced globally every year, valued at $6.4 billion USD (Moffitt, 2014). Over 95% of seaweed products are farmed, accounting for over a fifth of global annual aquaculture production (Moffitt, 2014). Out of the 33 countries that harvest seaweed, China is the largest producer by a significant margin with limited production in Western countries. Cultivation of seaweed grew 50% globally between 2004 and 2014 (Nayar & Bott, 2014). However, the demand for it is still outpacing supply as the global seaweed market doubled from 2000 to 2012 (West et al., 2016). Out of all groups cultivated, the market for red seaweeds is growing the most rapidly at 8% annually (West et al., 2016).

Seaweed produced for human consumption as fresh, dried, or processed products makes up 80% of the value of the global market while the remainder is mainly used in pharmaceuticals, agricultural fertilizer, and aquaculture feed (Buchholz et al., 2012; McHugh, 2003; Nayar & Bott, 2014; West et al., 2016). Algal hydrocolloids, such as carrageenan and agar, are used as emulsifying, gelling, or water retention agents. However, sustainable food production is a popular topic with which more people can engage compared to seaweed cultivation for alternative energy use or high-end cosmetics that are non-essential. In the international edible seaweed market, the most dominant species are the red seaweeds Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma spp., which are used to produce carrageenan (Moffitt, 2014). These are followed by seaweeds consumed dried or raw, such as Laminaria japonica (kombu or Japanese kelp), Gracilaria spp. (ogo, limu), Undaria pinnatifida (wakame) and Pyropia spp. (nori). Pyropia (formerly referred to as Porphyra) is by far the most valuable seaweed species with two species, P. yezoenisis and P. tenera, constituting the bulk of global production (Jensen, 1996; Levine & Sahoo, 2009).

Numerous health benefits are attributed to seaweed including high levels of iodine, fiber, and trace minerals, although nutrient contents vary greatly across species (Fleurence, 1999; MacArtain et al., 2007). For example, the calcium concentration in some seaweeds exceeds that of whole milk, making it particularly attractive for use in health food or vegan products (MacArtain et al., 2007). Given the health benefits associated with consuming seaweed, tremendous growth potential exists for this product in health-conscious markets within the US, Canada, and Europe.

## Seaweed in the United States

The supply of farmed, wild harvested, and imported seaweed has grown over the past decades in the United States as the American palate begins to accept and integrate seaweed. Seaweed imports increased 65% from 1999 to 2008 (Nayar & Bott, 2012). In 2016, the U.S. imported over 31 metric tons of seaweed, a 19.7% increase from 2015 (NOAA, 2017). This seaweed was valued at about $146 million USD (NOAA, 2017). Most edible seaweed production occurs on the east coast and in Hawai’i, largely through the harvest of Chondrus crispus (irish moss) and Palmaria palmata (dulse). More recently, aquaculturists have begun cultivating Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) and Gracilaria spp (ogo or limu) as well. There is also an increasing effort in the US to move towards an ecosystem-based approach known as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), a technique that harnesses the benefits of culturing two or more species from different trophic levels together. 

Rapid increase in demand for seaweed products is expected to continue domestically due to the potential for a new, sustainable, and healthy protein source (Buck et al., 2017). This has already been seen in Maine where seaweed sales doubled every year for the first 6 years of seaweed aquaculture production, between 2009-2015 (Lem, 2016). The easiest market entry point for seaweed domestically is in high-end restaurants. Chefs are drawn by its rich nutrition profile and are experimenting with it at increasing rates (Mouritsen, 2012). Out of the most commonly consumed species, Pyropia spp. and Palmaria palmata  have been identified as having the highest protein quantity and quality respectively (Holdt and Kraan, 2011). Despite varying substantially across species, the nutritional aspect of seaweed is crucial to its potential marketability (MacArtain et al., 2007; McHugh, 2003).

## Seaweed in California

Despite limited seaweed aquaculture research and development in California, seaweed harvest is growing rapidly. In 2004, harvested seaweed amounted to over 33,000 metric tons, making it the 5th most landed taxon by weight on the west coast (Norman et al., 2007). As of 2014, harvesting of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) has declined rapidly, while edible seaweed harvest (e.g. species from Pyropia, Laminaria, and Monostrema) has increased (CDFW, 2014). 

The seaweed harvest occurs primarily in northern California, with many commercial harvesters operating in Mendocino County and near San Francisco (e.g. Strong Arm Farms in Sonoma, Mendocino Sea Vegetable Company and Rising Tide Sea Vegetables in Mendocino). There are strict harvesting regulations including permitted areas, protected species, and limits on the annual harvest quantities. Commonly hand harvested seaweed species in California are Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp), Nereocystis luetkeana (bull kelp), Mastocarpus papillatus (turkish washcloth), Laminaria setchellii (kombu) and Stephanocystis osmundacea (bladder chain kelp) (CDFW, 2014). 

While coastal seaweed aquaculture has developed to varying extents on the eastern seaboard and in Hawai’i, businesses and stakeholders are just starting to consider growing seaweed off the coast of California. Currently, no ocean farmed seaweed exists in California. Suitable local seaweed species, methods for culturing them in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the economic feasibility of farm methods still need to be identified. Therefore, seaweed aquaculture remains limited in California, with the only existing production occurring in tanks on land.

The three current land based seaweed farms in California are: Monterey Bay Seaweeds in Moss Landing, Carlsbad Aquafarm in Carlsbad, and The Cultured Abalone Farm in Santa Barbara. The farms in Santa Barbara and Carlsbad primarily grow shellfish but augment their operations with production of Gracilaria pacifica. Meanwhile, Monterey Bay Seaweed grows Palmaria palmata (Northeast Atlantic dulse), Gracilaria spp., and Ulva spp in recirculating tanks as its sole products. In Santa Barbara, G. pacifica is used for abalone and fish feed, and sold to restaurants and food processors. Monterey Bay Seaweeds sells to chefs and high-end restaurants in the wider Monterey Bay Area (e.g. San Francisco, Santa Cruz), and these seaweeds are processed live and transported in saline water to their destination. The existing seaweed market can provide useful insight into potential seaweed candidates, target markets, and ways to add value through processing. 

## Potential for seaweed in the Southern California Bight

Nutrient-rich, upwelled waters off the southern California coast provide a unique opportunity to cultivate seaweed with minimal inputs (Sautter & Thunell, 1991). These are the same waters that support the algae-dominated kelp forest ecosystems that line the region’s coastline (Brzezinski et al., 2013). The environmental conditions of the Southern California Bight, the coastline between Point Conception and San Diego, also cater to the strict light and temperature requirements that many cultivated seaweeds have. Water temperatures and photoperiods in the region are relatively homogenous year-round (Appendix B). In addition to physical and chemical ocean properties, the Southern California Bight is also an epicenter for the health-conscious food market in the United States (Guthman, 2004). Having immediate access to the target market will likely lead to more economic success for the seaweed aquaculture industry (D. Bush, pers comm, 2018; M. Graham, pers comm, 2018).

Despite the numerous promising characteristics of the Southern California Bight for seaweed aquaculture, the industry remains underdeveloped. Part of the current dialogue in the industry focuses on the decision to site production onshore or offshore. Delicate species that are likely to fragment benefit from the less dynamic conditions when cultured on land (M. Graham, pers comm). Onshore farms are much easier to get permitted but are typically more energy intensive and expensive to operate (D. Bush, pers comm, B. Friedman, pers comm, 2017; Huguenin, 1976;). Open-ocean farms could be a good alternative to land-based systems since there are few inputs in the form of energy, seawater intake, and added nutrients (Nobre et al 2010). However, open-ocean farms don’t come without challenges in California. Spatial conflicts with other ocean users such as the Navy, commercial fishers, and tourism operations exist, but could be minimized with careful planning (Gentry et al., 2017). Understanding the tradeoffs between onshore and offshore may enable decision makers to make more informed choices regarding future seaweed aquaculture development along the Southern California Bight. 

## Environmental benefits and challenges

Encouraging local cultivation has significant environmental implications, as most seaweed consumed in southern California is imported (Figure 1). Imported produce items, such as seaweed, have a significantly higher carbon footprint due to their transport and electricity use for storage, packaging, and transport operations (Jones, 2002; Sim, 2007). Imported produce also contributes more to climate change, ocean acidification, and abiotic depletion than produce that is domestically grown (Sim, 2007). Furthermore, there are likely added benefits to growing seaweed in our marine environment. These range from absorbing excess terrestrial nutrients present in runoff to moderating ocean acidification (Hirata et al 1994, Grote 2016, Kang et al 2014, Kim et al 2015). The last characteristic is particularly relevant to shellfish aquaculture, as shellfish development can be retarded by shifts in pH and carbonate chemistry (Chung et al., 2013). 
As climate shifts the regular range of local ocean conditions, it may be pertinent to consider integrating seaweed into an IMTA or co-culture system to help mitigate localized effects of ocean warming and acidification. Additionally, some species of seaweed have high nutrient uptake capacities, reincorporating nutrients like ammonium that is released from suspended mussel farms (Cohen & Neori, 1991; Grote, 2016; Kang et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2015). While shellfish could also provide environmental benefits as filter-feeders, expansion of the industry should be coupled with conservative practices that limit the net footprint in our oceans. Thus, integrating new species into an existing farm could be a more sustainable practice moving forward.

In general, concerns still persist regarding the greater aquaculture industry like escape, benthic and aquatic pollution from waste and excess feed, and use of antibiotics that may create drug-resistant parasites and bacteria. However, many of these do not apply to properly managed seaweed aquaculture (Costa-Pierce, 2002). Cultivating native species greatly reduces the ecological impacts of escape. Seaweeds are net nutrient sinks which limits their environmental footprint and makes them valuable in IMTA systems (Troell et al., 2009). Finally, no pesticide or freshwater inputs are required to grow seaweed in the Southern California Bight. This is particularly important given the region’s limited water resources and frequent bouts with drought (MacDonald, 2007). 

There are still concerns about local seaweed aquaculture offshore in addition to the spatial issues outlined in the previous section. The most unrelenting concern is marine mammal entanglement (R. Lovell, pers comm, 2017). There have been 5 reported cases globally of turtle and cetacean entanglement in offshore mussel farm equipment, which is structurally similar to seaweed aquaculture equipment (Young, 2015). Although entanglement is suspected to be underreported, 5 occurrences in the last two decades suggest fairly small risk (Lindell and Bailey, 2015). Moreover, the risk of marine mammal aquaculture entanglement is significantly less than that of traditional fishing gear (Young, 2015). 

## Project objectives

Perhaps the greatest challenge to growing seaweed in the Southern California Bight is that interested parties simply don’t have the framework for a successful seaweed aquaculture operation in the region. While more information is available for onshore farming, questions remain for both onshore and offshore systems about what species to grow, when and where to grow those species, what cultivation method to use, and how profitable these operations could be. Because seaweed aquaculture in the Southern California Bight promises less risk, fewer environmental threats, and more environmental benefits than traditional terrestrial agriculture and other forms of aquaculture, there is growing interest both onshore and offshore from groups like Ventura Shellfish Enterprise, the Port of San Diego, and Catalina Sea Ranch. Our project completed a comprehensive analysis of the ideal candidate species with regards to the requirements for their cultivation and the relative economic feasibility of doing so. To accomplish this, we set out the following project objectives:

1. Identify southern California candidate seaweed species and the appropriate cultivation 
2. Determine key factors that influence economic feasibility in each species-farm system through the use of a bioeconomic model 
3. Perform a preliminary investigation of incorporating seaweed into an existing mussel farm

Through the first objective, we selected the most promising species from those native to the Southern California Bight using a mixed criteria of technical ease and market suitability. In the next section, we projected the economic feasibility of the seaweed aquaculture industry in the region via a synthesis of estimated farm costs and annual biological yield. We also outlined the variables and processes that stakeholders should focus on to improve business sustainability. Finally, we examined the benefits to both industries of integrating seaweed cultivation into existing mussel aquaculture through our partnership with Santa Barbara Mariculture, an open-ocean mussel farm off the coast of Hope Ranch.
